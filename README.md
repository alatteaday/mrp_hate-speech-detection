# Why Is It Hate Speech? Masked Rationale Prediction for Explainable Hate Speech Detection (COLING 2022)
**Paper link: [COLING](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.577/)  |  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00243)** <br>

## Initial Settings
1. Clone this git repository
```
git clone https://github.com/alatteaday/mrp_hate-speech-detection/
```
2. Install packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the codes for training or testing models
## Models
If you would like to run the models, you can download these compressed files via the Google drive links: ['finetune_1st.tar.gz'](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BCbgKYNH1-uI_hB18dHRez-Sr3F3VFu4/view?usp=share_link) and ['finetune_2nd.tar.gz'](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cHpBFWFWq8-o6vLFAbDVcm5Mt2SZY_l8/view?usp=share_link). If you would like to run the final hate speech detection models, you only need the **'finetune_2nd'** and don't have to get 'finetune_1st'. <br>
'finetune_1st' includes the checkpoints of the pre-finetuned models. Each of names shows what's the pre-finetuning method and some infos of the hyperparameters.
```
📁finetune_1st
 ╰─ 📁{checkpoint name}
     ╰─ checkpoint
```
'finetune_2nd' includes the checkpoints of the final models finetuned on hate speech detection. The upper folders indicate which pre-finetuned parameter was used for intialization among the checkpoints in the 'finetune_1st' folder. Each of pre-finetuned checkpoints was finetuned on both two and three-class classification for hate speech detection according to HateXplain benchmark. The two classes are 'non-toxic' and 'toxic', and the three classes are 'normal', 'offensive', and 'hate speech'.

```
📁finetune_2nd
 ╰─ 📁{the pre-finetuned checkpoint name}
     ╰─ 📁{the checkpoint name}
         ╰─ checkpoint 
```

## Test
For testing a model, run second_test.py like below:
```python
python second_test.py --test -m {the model path to test}
```
If you run a model which trained on two-class detection, it would be tested for Bias-based metrics of hateXplain benchmark. And a model which trained on three-class detection, you could get the results for Performance-based metrics and Explainability-based metrics. 
## Train
To train a hate speech detection model, you need a pre-finetuned model. If you enter the 'bert-based-uncased' instead of the model path as the ```-pf_m``` argument, you can finetune the pre-trained BERT base model on hate speech detection. And you need to set the ```--num_labels``` argument which means the number of the detection class as 2 or 3. 
```python
python second_train.py -pf_m {the pre-finetuned model path to train on hate speech detection} --num_labels {the number of classes: 2 or 3}
```
